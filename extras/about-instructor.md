## About Me

I obtained concurrently a B.S. in Mathematics, a B.S. in Physics, and a M.S. in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 2010.  Following this, I did a stint at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) as a post-baccalaureate researcher before continuing on to a graduate program at the University of Washington in Seattle (UW), while continuing research at LANL during summers.  After obtaining my Ph.D. in Mathematics from UW in 2017, I spent three years as a post-doc at Louisiana State University and joined CSUF in 2020.

My research focuses on applications of algebra and algebraic geometry to various problems in pure and applied mathematics. Specific research interests include orthogonal polynomials, integrable systems, spectral theory of integral and differential operators, and noncommutative crepant resolutions. Additionally, his research includes work in computational fluid dynamics and high performance computing.

## Current Research Projects with Students
* Explicit formulas for some families of orthogonal matrix polynomials
* Using orthogonal matrix polynomials for nonlinear eigenvalue problems
* Connections between Battleship and discrete tomography
* Exploring MicroRobots with graph theory/group theory
