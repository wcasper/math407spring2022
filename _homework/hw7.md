### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* yelled aloud to an unsuspecting Calculus I class

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**  

For each of the following, find the minimal polynomial over $$\mathbb Q$$ of the specified element.

* (a) $$\sqrt{3-\sqrt{6}}$$
* (b) $$\sqrt{2} + i$$

**Problem 2:**

For each of the following, find the degree and a basis for the field extension 

* (a) $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2})$$ over $$\mathbb Q$$
* (b) $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{18})$$ over $$\mathbb Q$$
* (c) $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$$ over $$\mathbb Q$$
* (d) $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{6})$$ over $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{3})$$
* (e) $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{10})$$ over $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{5})$$

**Problem 3:**

Prove that $$x^2-3$$ is irreducible over $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$$

**Problem 4:**

Prove in detail that $$\mathbb Q(\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{7}) = \mathbb Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{7})$$

**Problem 5:**

Let $$E$$ be an extension field of $$F$$ and let $$\alpha,\beta\in E$$.
Suppose that $$\alpha$$ is transcendental over $$F$$ but is algebraic over $$F(\beta)$$.
Show that $$\beta$$ is algebraic over $$F(\alpha)$$.

**Problem 6:**

Let $$E$$ be an extension field of $$F$$ and let $$K$$ be an extension field of $$E$$.

* (a) Show that if $$E$$ is algebraic over $$F$$ and $$K$$ is algebraic over $$E$$, then $$K$$ is algebraic over $$F$$
* (b) Show that if $$\alpha,\beta$$ are algebraic over $$F$$, then so too are $$\alpha+\beta$$ and $$\alpha\beta$$.
