### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas

* carved in a block of artisanal wood in a local shop class

* written on a scroll with a handmade quill

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**

Let $$F = \mathbb Q(\sqrt{3}i)$$ and $$E=Q(\sqrt{3i},\sqrt[3]{2})$$ and consider the field automorphism

$$\sigma: F\rightarrow F,\quad \sqrt{3}i\mapsto -\sqrt{3}i.$$

Find all field homomorphisms $$\varphi: E\rightarrow\mathbb C$$ satisfying $$\phi(a) = \sigma(a)$$ for all $$a\in F.$$

**Problem 2:**

Let $$F=\mathbb Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$$ and $$E=\mathbb Q(\sqrt[3]{2},i\sqrt{3})$$.
Determine the order of each of the following groups.

* (a) $$\text{Aut}(F)$$
* (b) $$\text{Aut}(E)$$
* (c) $$\text{Aut}_F(E)$$

**Problem 3:**  

Let $$K$$ be the splitting field of $$x^3-5$$ over $$\mathbb Q$$.

* (a) Show that $$K=\mathbb Q(\sqrt[3]{5},i\sqrt{3})$$
* (b) Explicitly describe the elements of $$\text{Aut}(K)$$
* (c) Determine what group we have seen before that $$\text{Aut}(K)$$ is isomorphic to
* (d) Draw a subgroup diagram for $$\text{Aut}(K)$$ and subfield diagram of $$K$$ and indicate what subfields correspond to what subgroups under Galois correspondence.
